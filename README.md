## Environment Setup

The application uses an environment file (`.env`) for configuration.

1.  **Copy the example environment file:**

    ```

2.  **Set Core Variables:** Open the newly created `.env` file and verify or update the following core settings (These are the suggested local settings):

    APP_NAME="OrderPaymentAPI"
    APP_ENV=local
    APP_DEBUG=true
    APP_URL=http://localhost:8000
    ```

3.  **Generate Application Key:** This key is crucial for session and data encryption.
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

    ```bash
    php artisan jwt:secret
    ```

    ```

2.  **Create the SQLite database file:**
    ```bash
    touch database/database.sqlite
    ```
